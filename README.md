# Github commands

To create a new branch and then merge it into the main branch, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a new branch: (Where we will all work on our own work)
    
    ```
    git branch <branch_name>
    
    ```
    
2. Checkout the new branch: (Make sure we use that new branch)
    
    ```
    git checkout <branch_name>
    
    ```
    
3. Make your changes, then add and commit them:
    
    ```
    git add .
    git commit -m "Your commit message"
    
    ```
    
4. Switch back to the main branch:
    
    ```
    git checkout main
    
    ```
    
5. Pull the latest changes from the main branch:
    
    ```
    git pull origin main
    
    ```
    
6. Merge your new branch into the main branch:
    
    ```
    git merge <branch_name>
    
    ```
    
7. Finally, push the changes to GitHub:
    
    ```
    git push origin main
    
    ```
    

Replace `<branch_name>` with the name you want for your new branch.
